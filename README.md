I have developed a responsive landing page that is interactive navigation menu that changes back-ground color when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item .The technologies I have used are HTML to structure the menu CSS for styling and layout JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic functionality such as changing back-ground color when hovering on menu item This task was an incredible learning experience, allowing me to enhance my web development skills and apply best practices in creating modern, user-friendly interfaces..
